# Ethereum Business Glossary for BigQuery RAG

This document defines key concepts on the Ethereum blockchain. It is intended to serve as metadata for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that queries the `crypto_ethereum` public dataset in Google BigQuery. The definitions often reference specific tables and fields within that dataset.

---

## Account
An entity on the Ethereum network with an Ether (ETH) balance that can send transactions. Each account is identified by a unique address. There are two types of accounts:

* **Externally Owned Account (EOA):** An account controlled by a private key, typically managed by a human user via a wallet. EOAs can initiate transactions.
* **Contract Account:** An account controlled by the code of a smart contract. Contract accounts cannot initiate transactions on their own; they can only execute operations in response to a transaction they have received.

*__BigQuery Context:__ Addresses for both account types are found in `from_address` and `to_address` fields across tables like `transactions`, `traces`, and `token_transfers`.*

## Address
A unique 20-byte (40-character hexadecimal) identifier that represents an account on the Ethereum network. It always begins with `0x`.
* **Example:** `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e`

## Transaction
A cryptographically signed instruction sent from one account to another. A transaction is the only way to write or change data on the Ethereum blockchain. It must be initiated by an EOA and broadcast to the network.

* **Key Attributes:**
    * `from_address`: The address of the EOA that signed and sent the transaction.
    * `to_address`: The recipient address. If it's a contract address, the transaction will trigger the contract's code. If it's `null` or the zero address, it signifies a contract creation transaction.
    * `value`: The amount of Ether (in Wei, the smallest unit of ETH) to transfer.
    * `gas_limit`: The maximum amount of gas the sender is willing to pay for the transaction.
    * `gas_price`: The price per unit of gas the sender is willing to pay (in Wei).
    * `nonce`: A sequential counter for each transaction sent from an account, used to prevent replay attacks.
    * `input` or `data`: The payload of the transaction, containing arbitrary data or instructions for a smart contract.

*__BigQuery Context:__ The primary source for this data is the `transactions` table.*

## Transaction Receipt
An object containing data about the outcome of a processed transaction. It is generated once a transaction has been included in a block.

* **Key Attributes:**
    * `status`: A boolean indicating if the transaction succeeded (`1`) or failed (`0`).
    * `gas_used`: The actual amount of gas consumed by the transaction.
    * `cumulative_gas_used`: The total amount of gas used in the block up to and including this transaction.
    * `logs`: An array of log/event objects generated by the transaction's execution.

*__BigQuery Context:__ Key receipt data is available in the `transactions` table (e.g., `receipt_gas_used`, `receipt_status`). Full log data is in the `logs` table, joined by `transaction_hash`.*

## Gas
The computational unit used to measure the work required to execute a transaction or smart contract operation on the Ethereum network. Gas is paid in Ether (ETH) to compensate miners/validators for their computational resources.

* **Gas Fee Calculation:** The total fee for a transaction is calculated as:
    $$
    \text{Transaction Fee} = \text{gas\_used} \times \text{gas\_price}
    $$
* **Units:** Gas prices are typically denoted in **Gwei**, a smaller denomination of ETH.
    * 1 Gwei = $10^9$ Wei
    * 1 ETH = $10^9$ Gwei = $10^{18}$ Wei

*__BigQuery Context:__ Relevant fields are `gas`, `gas_price`, and `receipt_gas_used` in the `transactions` table.*

## Block
A collection of transactions, along with a block header, that has been verified and added to the Ethereum blockchain. Each block is cryptographically linked to the previous one, forming the "chain."

* **Key Attributes:**
    * `number`: The unique sequential number of the block.
    * `timestamp`: The time the block was mined/validated.
    * `hash`: The unique hash that identifies the block.
    * `parent_hash`: The hash of the preceding block.
    * `miner`: The address of the account that successfully created the block.

*__BigQuery Context:__ The primary source for this data is the `blocks` table.*

## Smart Contract
A program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address. Once deployed, its logic is immutable and executes automatically when predefined conditions are met.

*__BigQuery Context:__ Information about contracts can be found in the `contracts` table. Interactions with them are recorded in `transactions`, `logs`, and `traces`.*

## Trace (Internal Transaction)
An operation or value transfer that is triggered by a smart contract executing its code, rather than by an EOA directly. These are not independent transactions on the blockchain but are child actions of a parent transaction. They are essential for understanding the full scope of a contract's execution.

* **Types of Traces:**
    * `call`: A message call from one contract to another, potentially transferring value.
    * `create`: A contract deploying another contract.
    * `delegatecall`: A special type of call where a contract executes code from another contract, but within its own context (state).
    * `selfdestruct`: A call to destroy a contract and send its remaining ETH balance to a specified address.

*__BigQuery Context:__ The primary source for this data is the `traces` table. A single transaction hash can have many associated traces.*

## Log (Event)
A low-cost way for smart contracts to emit signals during a transaction's execution. Events are a form of write-only storage on the blockchain, used to notify external listeners (like applications or users) that a specific action has occurred. For example, a token transfer emits a `Transfer` event.

* **Key Attributes:**
    * `address`: The address of the contract that emitted the log.
    * `topics`: Indexed, searchable parameters of the event (e.g., the sender and recipient addresses in a transfer). The first topic is typically the hash of the event signature.
    * `data`: Non-indexed parameters of the event.

*__BigQuery Context:__ The primary source for this data is the `logs` table.*

## ERC-20 (Fungible Token Standard)
A technical standard for implementing fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Fungible tokens are interchangeable, meaning each unit is identical to every other unit (e.g., one dollar is the same as any other dollar). Most cryptocurrencies on Ethereum (like USDC, DAI, SHIB) are ERC-20 tokens.

* **Standard Events:** A key feature is the standardized `Transfer(from, to, value)` event, which makes tracking transfers simple.

*__BigQuery Context:__ Token information is in the `tokens` table. All ERC-20 transfers can be queried from the `token_transfers` table.*

## ERC-721 (Non-Fungible Token Standard)
A technical standard for implementing non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Each NFT is unique, indivisible, and can have a distinct value and set of attributes. This standard is the foundation for digital collectibles, art, and virtual real estate.

* **Key Feature:** Unlike ERC-20, each token is tracked individually with a unique `tokenId`.

*__BigQuery Context:__ NFT transfers are also found in the `token_transfers` table, distinguishable by the `token_type` field. You would join with the `tokens` table to confirm the standard.*
